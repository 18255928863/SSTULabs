Recoloring Shader Rework TODO
Code
	MFT variant name not updated properly -- is being updated to model name
Adapter Textures
	First pass done.  Textures exist.  Need seam cleanup on diff/spec for painted textures.  Need diff/spec/nrm cleanup for gold/orange textures.
Adapter Configs
	Need to rename default texture set along with finding good names for the various mask-based sets
Tank Models
	MFT-A/B - Need to re-export models for UV changes for the piping bits.
	MFT-D - Need to finish geometry detail additions both for tanks and for adapters.  Rebake.
	MFT-S - Need to finish geometry and UV layouts.  I think the problem was lack of available space for all of the AO's needed, combined with needing to hide the seam along the circumference of the tank.
	MFT-L - Need complete model rework.  Will likely hold off on doing anything on these until the upcoming scheduled LC reworking.
Tank Textures
	A/B/C/CF/SF
		White-S
		White-P
		Silver
		Gold
		Orange1/2/3
		Mask1/2/3/4
	D - AO, NRM.  Need to add shading details to the AOmap rather than diffuse texture.
	L?
	All - figure out mapping for detail bits.  What parts will be silver, what will be gray.  What will be masked for each channel.
	Piping AO is not showing up on models -- texture set error, shader error, or ??
Tank Configs
	A/B/C/CF/SF
	D
	L?
Mount Models
	Need to re-UV many of them in order to allow for all stripe patterns.
Mount Textures
	Need masks for all
	Need re-export for all using separate AO bake
