	title = Zero Boiloff - Active Insulation
	description = Including an active radiator and heat pump system into the passive insulation of our insulated fuel tanks has allowed us to completely eliminate cryogenic fuel boiloff (at the cost of a constant input of electricity to keep the pumps running).

	title = Zero Boiloff - Passive Insulation
	description = Using the newly developed advanced composites in our Zero-Boiloff tanks has allowed us to dramatically reduce their structural mass, resulting in even higher efficiency when using cryogenic fuels.  Requires a bit more electricity to run larger pumps and radiators due to less passive insulation from thinner tank walls.
