	@description = SSTU - StationCore - DOS-FEM - The Dockable Orbital Segment series of station modules offer an affordable selection of station modules for the construction of orbital installations.  When the station module engineering team was tasked with the creation of an entertainment module the first thing they tried was making the module have a 'fun shape'.  This bar-bell shaped module is the result of said ingenuity, and regardless of if the shape contributes to its effect, the module is fully equipped with entertainment and fitness technology to keep the crew happy and in shape.  Includes minimal habitation and storage capacity for a crew of three for short durations.
